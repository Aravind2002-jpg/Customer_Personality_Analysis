# Customer Personality Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Customer Personality Analysis is a project that helps businesses understand their customers better. By analyzing purchasing behavior, demographics, and engagement patterns, companies can segment customers into groups and design targeted marketing strategies.  

This project uses a **marketing campaign dataset** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning modeling** for customer segmentation and prediction.

## 📊 Analysis Performed  
1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  
2. Visualization of Customer Segments  
3. Classification using Logistic Regression & Random Forest  
4. Clustering using KMeans for customer segmentation  
5. Insights for Marketing Strategy

## 📈 Results & Insights  
- Customers with higher income and middle-aged groups spend more on luxury items (wine, gold).  
- Web engagement does not always translate to campaign acceptance.  
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in predicting customer response.  
- Clustering revealed distinct groups (high spenders, budget shoppers, family-oriented customers).
